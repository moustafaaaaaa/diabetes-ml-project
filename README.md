Machine Learning model to predict diabetes

This project uses a machine learning model to predict whether a person has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements.

The dataset used is the **Pima Indians Diabetes Database** from Kaggle/UCI:
- 768 rows, 8 features (e.g., glucose, BMI, age)
- Target: 0 (No diabetes), 1 (Diabetes)

 model used is SVM

 with evluation accuracy 78%

 there is a simple prediction function in the end
